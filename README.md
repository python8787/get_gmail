Here are the general steps to obtain the credentials.json file:

Create a Project in Google Cloud Console:

`Go to the Google Cloud Console.
Create a new project or select an existing project.
Enable the Gmail API:`

`In the Cloud Console, navigate to the "APIs & Services" > "Dashboard" page.
Click on the "+ ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES" button.
Search for "Gmail API" and enable it for your project.
Create Credentials:`

`Once the Gmail API is enabled, go to the "APIs & Services" > "Credentials" page.
Click on "Create Credentials" and choose "OAuth client ID."
Select "Desktop App" as the application type.
Give it a name and click "Create."
Download the JSON file, and this is your credentials.json.
After obtaining the credentials.json file, you can use it in your Python script as shown in the previous example.
